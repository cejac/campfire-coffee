#Campfire Coffee

Created a website for an upcoming coffee company 'Campfire Coffee'. The website was to include three pages: 
1. A page detailing the store's hours along with specific pictures
2. A page that allowed the client to see the hourly and daily store stats as well as barista scheduling needs per store within a readable table. Functionality to input new stores as they opened was also added.  
3. A style guide was included for the client's reference. 

##N6
- Created an object literal for each store. Rendered each store to appear on the page along with it's stats in a list format.

##N7
- Refactored cookie stand objects unsing constructors and instances. Changed the data to appear on the page within tables.

##N8
- Added an input form to sales data page and bound this to an event listener. Newly inputted data from the form renders at the end of each table and updates totals.

##N10
- Added styling to each page
- Linked all the pages together so that the site is fully functional.
